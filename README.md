## Part 1: Understanding the Objects on the Stack and Heap

**Objective:** The point of this exercise is to make sure you understand the mechanism for passing objects as parameters, and what that looks like in memory.

1. Using the [Python Tutor code visualizer](https://pythontutor.com/java.html#mode=edit) for Java, capture an image of a diagram showing the local variables and parameters of main and riddle just before riddle returns for the code below.
    * Save the image taken above to your project as Part1_2.jpg.
    * ![Part1_2.jpg](..%2F..%2FOneDrive%2FDesktop%2FVa%20Thao%2FCS-12%2FLab%2009%2FPart1_2.jpg)
2. Answer the following question in the **text** block below:
    * Is the **blank** object mutable or immutable? How can you tell?

```text
blank object in the provided Java code is mutable.
 This can be inferred from the fact that its state changes 
 after being passed as a parameter to the riddle method. 
 In the riddle method, both the x parameter and the p 
 parameter's x and y values are used in calculations, 
indicating that the Point object is mutable and its state can be modified.
```

```java
import java.awt.Point;

public class Puzzler {
    public static int riddle(int x, Point p) {
        x = x + 7;
        return x + p.x + p.y;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 5;
        Point blank = new Point(1, 2);
        System.out.println(riddle(x, blank));
        System.out.println(x);
        System.out.println(blank.x);
        System.out.println(blank.y);
    }
}
```

3. Using the [Python Tutor code visualizer](https://pythontutor.com/java.html#mode=edit) for Java, capture a stack diagram showing the state of the below program just before **findCenter** returns.
    * Save the image taken above to your project as Part1_3.jpg.

4. Using the [Python Tutor code visualizer](https://pythontutor.com/java.html#mode=edit) for Java, capture a stack diagram showing the state of the program just before **distance** returns.
    * Save the image taken above to your project as Part1_4.jpg.
    * ![img_2.png](img_2.png)
5. Answer the following question below in the **text** block below:
    * Explain how the return values from #3 and #4 differ.

```text
#3 (findCenter(Rectangle box)) returns a Point object representing a position,
 while #4(distance(center, blank)) returns a double value representing a distance.
```

```java
import java.awt.Point;
import java.awt.Rectangle;

public class RectangleGymnastics {
    public static double distance(Point p1, Point p2) {
        int dx = p2.x - p1.x;
        int dy = p2.y - p1.y;
        return Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    }

    public static Point findCenter(Rectangle box) {
        int x = box.x + box.width / 2;
        int y = box.y + box.height / 2;
        return new Point(x, y);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Point blank = new Point(5, 8);
        Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(0, 2, 4, 4);
        Point center = findCenter(rect);
        double dist = distance(center, blank);
        System.out.println(dist);
    }
}
```

## Part 2: Exploring Aliasing

Recall that aliases are two variables that refer to the same object.

1. Using the [Python Tutor code visualizer](https://pythontutor.com/java.html#mode=edit) for Java, capture a diagram that shows the state of the program just before the end of main.
    * Save the image taken above to your project as Part2_1.jpg.
    * ![img_3.png](img_3.png)
2. What is the output of the program?
    * Put the output in the text block below

```text
(5, 8)
```

3. At the end of main, are p1 and p2 aliased? Why or why not?
    * Put your answer in the text block below

```text

At the end of main, p1 and p2 are not aliased. Aliasing occurs 
when two variables refer to the same object in memory. In this case, 
p1 and p2 refer to different Point objects returned by the findCenter
 method for different Rectangle objects (box1 before and after grow method call). 
 Therefore, p1 and p2 are not aliased; they reference distinct Point objects.
```

```java
import java.awt.Point;
import java.awt.Rectangle;

public class Aliasing {
    public static void printPoint(Point p) {
        System.out.println("(" + p.x + ", " + p.y + ")");
    }

    public static Point findCenter(Rectangle box) {
        int x = box.x + box.width / 2;
        int y = box.y + box.height / 2;
        return new Point(x, y);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle box1 = new Rectangle(2, 4, 7, 9);
        Point p1 = findCenter(box1);
        printPoint(p1);
        box1.grow(1, 1);
        Point p2 = findCenter(box1);
        printPoint(p2);
    }
}
```

## Part 3: String Playground

The following code fragment traverses a string and checks whether it has the same number of opening and closing parentheses:

```java
String s = "((3 + 7) * 2)";
int count = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
    char c = s.charAt(i);
    if (c == '(') { count++; }
    else if (c == ')') { count--; }
}
```

1. Encapsulate the above fragment in a method in the [StringPlayground](src/StringPlayground.java) class that takes a string argument and returns the final value of count.
2. Test your method with multiple strings, including some that are balanced and some that are not.
    * Screenshot your output and add it to your project as Part3_2.jpg
    * ![img_4.png](img_4.png)
3. Generalize the code so that it works on any string.
    * What could you do to generalize it more?

## Part 4: Large Numbers

Many encryption algorithms depend on the ability to raise large integers to a power. Below is a method that implements an efficient algorithm for integer exponentiation:

```java
public static int pow(int x, int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;
    // find x to the n/2 recursively
    int t = pow(x, n / 2);
    // if n is even, the result is t squared
    // if n is odd, the result is t squared times x
    if (n % 2 == 0) {
        return t * t;
    } else {
        return t * t * x;
    }
}
```

The problem with this method is that it works only if the result is small enough to be represented by an int.

1. In [BigIntRewrite.java](src/BigIntRewrite.java) rewrite the above method so that the result is a **BigInteger**.
    * The **parameters** should still be **integers**, though.
    * You should use the **BigInteger** methods **add** and **multiply**.
    * Donâ€™t use **BigInteger.pow;** that would spoil the fun.
